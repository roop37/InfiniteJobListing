# Candidate Application Platform Documentation

## Overview

The Candidate Application Platform is a web application designed to provide job seekers with a seamless experience for browsing and applying to job listings. It offers a user-friendly interface with features such as job filtering, infinite scroll, and responsive design.

## How It Works

The platform fetches job listings from an API endpoint and presents them to users in the form of cards. Users can interact with these cards to view detailed job information and apply to positions. The key functionalities of the platform include:

- **Job Listings**: Job listings are fetched from the API and displayed as cards on the UI. Each card contains essential information such as job title, company name, location, job description, experience required, and an apply button/link.

- **Filters**: Users can apply filters to refine their job search based on various criteria, including minimum experience, company name, location, remote/on-site, tech stack, role, and minimum base pay. The platform updates the displayed job listings in real-time as filters are applied.

- **Infinite Scroll**: To enhance the browsing experience, the platform implements infinite scroll. As users scroll down the page, additional job listings are fetched and seamlessly integrated into the existing list, eliminating the need for manual pagination.

- **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different devices and screen sizes. Whether users access the platform from a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone, they can expect a consistent and user-friendly experience.
