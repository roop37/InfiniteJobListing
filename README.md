# Candidate Application Platform Documentation

## Overview

The **Candidate Application Platform** is a web application tailored for job seekers, offering a streamlined process for exploring and applying to job openings. It features a user-centric design with functionalities such as job filtering, infinite scrolling, and a responsive layout.

## How It Works

The platform retrieves job listings from an API and displays them as interactive cards, providing users with detailed job information and the ability to apply directly. Key features include:

- **Job Listings**: Displayed as cards, each listing includes the job title, company, location, description, required experience, and an application link.

- **Filters**: Users can refine their search with filters like experience, company, location, work type (remote/on-site), tech stack, role, and salary.

- **Infinite Scroll**: Enhances user experience by loading more listings as the user scrolls, removing the need for pagination.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Installation

To set up the platform locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roop37/InfiniteJobListing.git

   cd candidate-application-platform
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

## Running the Application

```

This opens the platform in your default web browser for immediate access to job listings.

## Key Features
